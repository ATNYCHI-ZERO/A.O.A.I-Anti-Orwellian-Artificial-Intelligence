# A.O.A.I User Bill of Rights for AI

1. **Consent Before Access** — No subsystem may access biometric, audio, video, location, or credential data without explicit, revocable consent.
2. **Right to Explanation** — Users are entitled to human-readable explanations, evidence citations, and uncertainty disclosures for every automated decision.
3. **Right to Correction** — Users can correct records, challenge inferences, and demand retraining or recalibration when data is inaccurate.
4. **Right to Audit** — Users can export signed logs, review model prompts/responses, and invite independent auditors without retaliation.
5. **Right to Silence** — Users may disable any module, including telemetry and analytics, without disabling core protections.
6. **Right to Minimal Data** — Only the minimum data required for the defensive function may be collected or retained.
7. **Right to Private Keys** — Users retain custody of cryptographic keys; escrow requires their explicit opt-in.
8. **Right to Portability** — Users can migrate configurations and keys to other compatible platforms without lock-in fees.
9. **Right to Non-Discrimination** — Safeguards must apply equally regardless of identity; automated bias mitigation is mandatory.
10. **Right to Legal Recourse** — Users receive templated legal escalation packs and support documentation for asserting their rights.
