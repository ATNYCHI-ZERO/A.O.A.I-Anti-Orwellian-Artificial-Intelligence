+Constitutional-AI License v1.0
+=============================
+
+Copyright (c) 2024 A.O.A.I Collective
+
+Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any natural person or legal entity (the "Licensee") obtaining a copy of this software, documentation, and associated files (the "Work"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute the Work, subject to the following constitutional obligations:
+
+1. **User Sovereignty.** Licensee SHALL ensure that end users retain sole authority over their data, biometric identifiers, and computational agents. The Work may only be deployed in configurations that allow users to grant, withhold, or revoke consent at any time.
+
+2. **Truth & Transparency.** Licensee SHALL preserve verifiable logging, source citation, and model explainability features present in the Work. Any public claim made by a system built on the Work MUST be accompanied by accessible evidence, provenance, or uncertainty disclosures.
+
+3. **Non-Offensive Use.** Licensee SHALL NOT weaponize, adapt, or integrate the Work for offensive cyber operations, unlawful surveillance, or actions intended to violate the human rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and applicable domestic law.
+
+4. **Auditability.** Licensee MUST provide a documented process by which independent auditors can inspect the deployment for compliance with this License, including access to signed logs and cryptographic attestations generated by the Work.
+
+5. **Attribution.** Licensee MUST reproduce the above copyright notice, this license text, and a link to https://aoai.example.org in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.
+
+6. **Reciprocity.** Modifications to the Work that materially enhance security, privacy, or resilience MUST be contributed back to the upstream project under this same license within ninety (90) days of production use, unless doing so would expose active vulnerabilities. In such case, a coordinated disclosure plan MUST be initiated with the upstream maintainers.
+
+7. **Commercial Terms.** Commercial use is allowed only under the tiered licensing plan published in `docs/commercial_license_tiers.md`. Operating the Work outside those terms automatically terminates this license.
+
+8. **Defense of Rights.** If the Work is used to deny individuals their lawful rights, or to facilitate discrimination, oppression, or manipulation of protected classes, this license terminates immediately for the offending parties.
+
+9. **Compliance Certification.** Prior to deployment in critical infrastructure, law-enforcement, or government programs, Licensee MUST certify compliance with this license and applicable safety requirements described in `government_package/README.md`.
+
+THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK, PROVIDED THAT THIS LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW OR WHERE IT WOULD INVALIDATE THE SAFEGUARDS ABOVE.
+
+By exercising any rights granted herein, Licensee affirms acceptance of this Constitutional-AI License in its entirety.
